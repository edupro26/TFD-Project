## Usage

Run the following command in the terminal to start the `__main__.py` script:

```python __main__.py```

This script will ask you to enter the number of nodes to create and an epoch duration. 
After that, it will spawn the nodes and run a workload simulating clients submitting transactions to one or more nodes.

An execution example is shown below:

```
$ python __main__.py
Enter the number of nodes: 5
Enter the epoch duration: 2
Nodes started

Running workload...
```


**Note**: Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.
